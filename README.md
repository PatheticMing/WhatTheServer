This is a remake of PC plugin: Core Protect but it for PocketMine edition

###IMPORTANT: The  database structure on the 0.1.3 version update has been changed! Please delete or backup your old database in order to let the plugin functions normally

###WARNING: Since I haven't really come back to work with this plugin, it has a very high chance to crash the server because the API version is very likely to be incompatible
